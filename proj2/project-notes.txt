- can't find algs4-source.jar in libraries. Is this why lab6 didn't work?

- diagram link: https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/image/commits-and-blobs.png

- start with init, status?

Initializing creates a .gitlet folder in current directory
    - also adds initial commit
If .gitlet is not present, it's not a gitlet repo


Store a file called .gitlet/pointers that contains a map from branch names to commits
    - also contains the HEAD pointer


Commits are stored in the .gitlet/commits folder
    - the file name of the commit is the hash
    - the commit is an object that points to a parent, has metadata, and points to one or more blobs

Blobs are stored in the .gitlet/blobs folder
    - blobs contain a file's contents
    - filename of the blob is the hash
