- can't find algs4-source.jar in libraries. Is this why lab6 didn't work?

- diagram link: https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/image/commits-and-blobs.png

- start with init, status?

Initializing creates a .gitlet folder in current directory
- also adds initial commit
If .gitlet is not present, it's not a gitlet repo

FILE STRUCTURE:
.gitlet
    refs
        HEAD - each of these files just contains the commitID as a string
        master
        branch2
        branch3
    commits
    blobs
    stage

Commits are stored in the .gitlet/commits folder
- the file name of the commit is the hash
- the commit is an object that points to a parent, has metadata, and points to zero or more blobs

Blobs are stored in the .gitlet/blobs folder
- blobs contain a file's contents as a text string
- filename of the blob is the hash

When adding a new commit, we need to:
- create the commit object with the blobs in stage
- save the commit object
- update the HEAD file and appropriate branch file

// TODO: use the below for blobbing?
//        String blobContents = readContentsAsString(fileToStage);
//        String blobName = sha1(List.of(blobContents));
//        File blobToStage = join(STAGE_DIR, blobName);
